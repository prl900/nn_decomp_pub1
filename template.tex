Changes in reflectance values or local textures that are separable from changes caused by other factors such as differences in atmospheric conditions, illumination and viewing angles, and soil moistures \citep{deng2008pca}.

The natural processes Earth surface 
The dynamics of the Earth surface follow defining a lower dimensional space.  he temporal variability of can be described using a number of components that is much lower than the images in the time series. From an algebra point of view, if each image is represented as a column of a matrix, we can say that this matrix has low rank. This fact has been already explored in remote sensing applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compress and filter noise from images \citep{}.

PCA decomposes a matrix into its principal components or eigenvectors and eigenvalues presenting them in decreasing order of identif the eigenvectors of 
For the case of remote sensing images, the PCA decomposition of series of images captured through time typically shows a decrease in the eigenvalues in which the largest part of the original variance can be explained with only a few components. This fact has been used to compress and also filter out noise in the images coming from clouds and other atmospheric effects.

When applying PCA to remote sensing images it is required to filter out the noise in the images, which are typically contaminated with clouds and other atmospheric effects. If noise is not removed, most of the variability in the images will be and PCA will capture it in its components. One of the main drawbacks of applying PCA is its inability to work with missing values. Some alternative implementations of Singular Value Decomposition that can work with missing data have been proposed but it is a common practice to assign these values a fixed value or apply interpolation techniques to the data previous to calculating its PCA.

In this work we explore an alternative methodology to PCA based on neural networks that can work with missing values. This methodology is tested using Sentinel 2 data and its results are compared to PCA using interpolated data for the missing values.

\section{Methodology}


There are many different possibilities of arranging the data before performing PCA or decomposing. 


\section{Data}

\subsection{Tiling}
To carry out the experiments in this work we used data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission \citep{drusch2012sentinel}. A constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit scans the Earth with a combined revisit period 10 days and spatial resolutions that range between 10 and 60 metres. Digital Earth Australia (DEA) \citep{dhu2017digital} offers Sentinel 2 for Australia adding further processing to the data, such as correction for atmospheric and terrain effects. DEA data is reprojected into Albers equal area and we maintained the images in this projection to carry out the experiments in this work.

From the DEA dataset we extracted a 7000 km\textsuperscript{2} area around the Australian Capital Territory region for the years 2018 and 2019. Spectrally, we chose a subset of seven bands: three in the visible channels, two in the near infra-red and two in the short wave infrared, corresponding to bands (2, 3, 4, 8, 8a, 11, 12) in the original dataset. Bands 8a, 11 and 12 have nominal resolutions of 20 metres and were upsampled using nearest neighbour into 10 metres, to match the other band's resolution.

The data was then split using regular tiles of 4 squared kilometers each one comprising the whole temporal extent. Figure aaaa contains a representation of the region and extent of each tile.

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
